# Kotlin conventions

## Naming conventions

- Module names are `capitalized`,

    E.g. `Learn`

- Variable name are `camelCase`: the first letter is still lowercase, but we use an uppercase to delineate a word boundary for readability.

    E.g. `maybe`, `upperCase`

- Type/data constructors begin with capital letters
